## Description
We created an application that can predict a person's salary from several parameters. The main purpose of developing an app that focuses on salary prediction is because in this day and age, questions around salary expectations are often part of the hiring process. And clarity on salary estimation is key in making career decisions. Therefore, we identified the need for a solution that can help job seekers to make realistic and strategic estimates of their expected salary.
