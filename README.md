# Mobile Development Project For Incomeify App

## Design Prototype
Before entering the code implementation process, we designed the UI of the application using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) which is a prototyping tools application.

Here is the [link](https://www.figma.com/file/j3gNiqCV7bMqzU4eOGYiJw/Prototype-Incomeify?type=design&node-id=10%3A16&mode=design&t=dqi8Rf7GOWud7zXO-1) to our design prototype.

## Code Implementation

The Incomeify app was created using Kotlin as its native programming language, aiming to provide insights into identify income or salary through given information from user input. The application adopts the MVVM architecture along with the Repository pattern, leveraging LiveData to seamlessly transmit data from the data source to the user interface. Additionally, Material Design is used for Design System.
